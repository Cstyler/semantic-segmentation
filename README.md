## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare the dataset

Download the ISBI 2012 dataset

### 3. Train the model

Using the script:

```bash
python train.py
```

Or use `Train.ipynb` for interactive training inside Jupyter.

### 4. Run inference

```bash
python predict.py checkpoint.pth isbi_2012_challenge/test/imgs/frame_0003.png
